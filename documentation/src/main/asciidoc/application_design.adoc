= Application Design

== Model alignement

The model of Floril√®ge data is under development and has been adapted to the one of the text mining data resulting in an absence of loss in the data.

== Data production

Until now the execution of the text mining workflow is done on the Migale platform at INRA.

The workflow is detailled in the <<production_processing.adoc#, production processing documentation>>

== Data Updates

The resulting text mining data is made available to the parent application maintainers as a downloadable file.

They can be downloaded at http://genome.jouy.inra.fr/~jbbohuon/uc-c-microbial-biodiversity/relations_zipped.txt
